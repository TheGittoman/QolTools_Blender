personal quality of life tools that I have noticed to make blendering much enjoyable
includes for now only:
    test class that is just there to test stuff, will remove at some point
    mirroring using shift+alt+x s z (x y z) and for negative mirror shift+ctrl+alt+x s z (x y z)
    mappings for double clicking a mesh to select linked and ctrl double click for adding to selection
