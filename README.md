personal quality of life tools that I have noticed to make blendering much enjoyable
includes for now only:
    test class that is just there to test stuff, will remove at some point
    mirroring using shift+alt+x s z (x y z) and for negative mirror shift+ctrl+alt+x s z (x y z)

TODO:
    make the keymapping simpler to allow using only one mirror class for mirroring,
    thus far I have not figured out a way to do it.
    make the list for keymaps to allow using other dictionaries than MIRROR for easier and
    more readable code and interactibility
